  <i>
   P. berghei
  </i>
  is one of the four malaria species that infect murine rodents from Central Africa that are
   infectious to laboratory rodents and easily maintained and transmitted by "Anopheles stephensi"
    in the laboratory. It serves as a good model for the human parasites with which it shares
    high homology in most essential aspects of structure, biochemistry and life cycle. Genome
    organisation is conserved between rodent and human parasites and the two share detailed synteny.

  has an estimated genome size of 18-20 Mb, with 14 chromosomes in the size range of 0.6 Mb to 3.8 Mb. DNA for this sequencing project was obtained from asynchronous bloodstages of clone 15cy1 of the ANKA
  strain of
  <i>
   P. berghei

 Whole genome shotgun sequencing has continued to high coverage. The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute
 plans on publishing the completed and annotated sequences of <i>P. berghei</i> ANKA in a peer-reviewed
 journal as soon as possible. Permission of the principal investigator should be obtained before
 publishing analyses of the sequence/open reading frames/genes on a chromosome or genome scale.
 The first-pass annotation of the assembled sequence is now available.
