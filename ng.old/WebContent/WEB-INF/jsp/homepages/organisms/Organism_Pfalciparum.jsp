 <p>
  <i>
   Plasmodium falciparum
  </i>
  is the most deadly of the five
  <i>
   Plasmodium
  </i>
  species that cause human malaria. Malaria has a massive impact on human health; it is the worlds second biggest killer after tuberculosis. Around 300 million clinical cases occur each year resulting in between 1.5 - 2.7 million deaths annually, the majority in sub-saharan Africa. It is estimated that 3,000 children under the age of five years fall victim to malaria each day. Around 40% of the worlds population are at risk.

 <p>
  The
  <i>
   P. falciparum
  </i>
  3D7 nuclear genome is 23.3 Mb in size, with a karyotype of 14 chromosomes. The G+C content is approximately 19%.
The
  <i>
   P. falciparum
  </i>
  genome is undergoing re-annotation. This process started in October 2007 with a weeklong workshop co-organized by staff from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Intistute and the EuPathDB team. Ongoing curation and sequence checking is being carried out by the Pathogen Genomics group.

 <p>
  The most recent sequence updates and annotations for the
  <i>
   P. falciparum
  </i>
  genome can be found in GeneDB.
 </p>
 <p>
  GeneDB has been funded by Wellcome Trust to provide full curation support for
  <i>
   P. falciparum
  </i>
  to meet the needs of the community. New annotations are constantly being added to keep up with published manuscripts and feedback from the
  <i>
   Plasmodium
  </i>
  research community. In collaboration with EuPathDB, genomic sequence data and annotations are regularly deposited on
  <a href="http://plasmodb.org/" class="external text" title="http://plasmodb.org/" rel="nofollow">
   PlasmoDB
  </a>
  where they can be integrated with other datasets and queried using customized queries.
