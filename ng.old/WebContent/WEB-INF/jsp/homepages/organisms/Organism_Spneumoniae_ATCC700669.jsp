   Streptococcus pneumoniae
  </i>
  (the pneumococcus) is a human commensal and pathogen that represents a major cause of otitis media, pneumonia, and meningitis. Worldwide, pneumococcal disease is thought to be responsible for over a million fatalities annually, including more than 800,000 deaths in children under 5 years of age living in developing countries

   S. pneumoniae
  </i>
  Spain23F lineage was among the first recognized pandemic clones and was responsible for almost 40% of penicillin-resistant pneumococcal infections in the United States in the late 1990s.

   S. pneumoniae
  </i>
  strain ATCC 700669, is a representative of the Spain23F lineage, and has been typed as sequence type (ST)81 by MLST.
