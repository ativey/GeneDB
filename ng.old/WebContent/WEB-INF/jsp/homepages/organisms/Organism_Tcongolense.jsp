   T. congolense
  </i>
  is a major livestock pathogen in Africa. Despite the severe disease it causes,
  <i>
   T. congolense
  </i>
  remains largely unstudied. The Sanger Institute's Pathogen Sequencing Unit (PSU), in collaboration with Professor David Barry (Glasgow University, UK), Dr Alberto Davila (Instituto Oswalso Cruz, Brazil) and Dr Phelix Majiwa (International Livestock Institute, Kenya), is carrying out a partial genome shotgun of this parasite, initially to a 1x coverage.

 <p>
  GeneDB has been funded by Wellcome Trust to provide full curation support for kinetoplastida genomes to meet the needs of the community. New annotations are constantly being added to keep up with published manuscripts and feedback from the Trypanosomatid research community. In collaboration with GeneDB, the EuPathDB genomic sequence data and annotations are regularly deposited on

 <p>
  This sequencing centre plans on publishing the completed and annotated sequences in a peer-reviewed journal as soon as possible. Permission of the principal investigator should be obtained before publishing analyses of the sequence/open reading frames/genes on a chromosome or genome scale. For further information see our data release policy.
