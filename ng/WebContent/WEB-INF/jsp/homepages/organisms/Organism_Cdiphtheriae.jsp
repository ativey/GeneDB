  <i>
   Corynebacterium diphtheriae
  </i>
  produces a potent bacteriophage-encoded protein exotoxin, diphtheria toxin, which causes the symptoms of diphtheria. This potentially fatal infectious disease is controlled in many developed countries by an effective immunisation programme. However, the disease has made a dramatic return in recent years, in particular within the Eastern European region.
  <i>
   C. diphtheriae
  </i>
  biotype gravis strain NCTC13129 was isolated in 1997 from a 72-year-old female with clinical diphtheria who had returned to the UK from a Baltic cruise.
