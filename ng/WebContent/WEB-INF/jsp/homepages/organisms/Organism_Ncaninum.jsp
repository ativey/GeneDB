  Please note: users should be aware of the preliminary nature both of the sequence assembly and the annotation. Systematic identifiers may change in later versions. Where possible, mappings will be provided and currently used identifiers will be retained. These will be searchable alongside any new identifiers.
 </p>
 <p>
  At present, the first pass annotation of the NC_LIV strain of N. caninum genome assembly (version 1.0) is available through GeneDB. For background information on the N. caninum project at The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute.

  Data release conditions
 </p>
 <p>
  The sequencing centre plans on publishing the completed and annotated sequences in a peer-reviewed journal as soon as possible. Permission of the principal investigators should be obtained before publishing analyses of the sequence/open reading frames/genes on a chromosome or genome scale.
