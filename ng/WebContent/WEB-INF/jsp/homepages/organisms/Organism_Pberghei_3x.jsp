  is one of the four malaria species that infect murine rodents from Central Africa that are infectious to laboratory rodents and easily maintained and transmitted by Anopheles stephensi in the laboratory. It serves as a good model for the human parasites with which it shares high homology in most essential aspects of structure, biochemistry and life cycle. Genome organisation is conserved between rodent and human parasites and the two share detailed synteny.

  has an estimated genome size of 25-27Mb, with 14 chromosomes in the size range of 0.6 Mb to 3.8 Mb. The chromosomes are numbered in ascending order of size, based on the size of chromosomes of the reference clones 8417 and cl15cy1 of the ANKA strain. DNA for this sequencing project was obtained from asynchronous bloodstages of clone 15cy1 of the ANKA strain of

 <p>
  This genome has been published in Hall et al., Science 307 (5706):82-86.       PMID: 15637271
Whole genome shotgun sequencing has continued to 8x coverage with a mixture of capillary and illumina sequencing platform. The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute plans on publishing the completed and annotated sequences of

  ANKA in a peer-reviewed journal as soon as possible. Permission of the principal investigator should be obtained before publishing analyses of the sequence/open reading frames/genes on a chromosome or genome scale. The annotated 8x version of the genome is expected to be available at the end 0f 2009.
