 <p>
  <i>
   Staphylococcus aureus
  </i>
  is an important nosocomial and community-acquired pathogen.
  <i>
   S. aureus
  </i>
  is the most common cause of hospital acquired infection, causing clinical disease in 2% of all patient admissions in the UK. Not only does it cause enormous numbers of infections, but
  <i>
   S. aureus
  </i>
  in hospitals are becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics. In several industrialised nations including parts of Europe, the US and Japan, 40-60&nbsp;% of all hospital
  <i>
   S. aureus
  </i>
  are now resistant to methicillin (methicillin-resistant
  <i>
   Staphylococcus aureus
  </i>
  , MRSA).
 </p>
 <p>
  MSSA476 is methicillin-sensitive strain, and was isolated from a patient in the community who developed severe invasive disease. MSSA476 belongs to a major global lineage associated with community-acquired disease. The strain has been typed as sequence type (ST)1 by MLST.
