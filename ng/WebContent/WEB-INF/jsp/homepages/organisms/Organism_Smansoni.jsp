 <p>
  Schistosomiasis affects approximately 210 million people in 76 countries, is a cause of serious morbidity and is estimated to account for greater than a quarter of a million deaths per annum. Schistosomiasis is caused by blood flukes of the genus
  <i>
   Schistosoma
  </i>
  (phylum Platyhelminthes) and
  <i>
   S. mansoni
  </i>
  is one of the three major subspecies.

  The
  <i>
   S. mansoni
  </i>
  genome is 363Mb in size, G+C content is approximately 35% and encodes at least 11,809 genes. The Pathogen Genomics group at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute played a major role in sequencing the genome of

  (see

   Data Release
  </span>
 </h2>
 <p>
  The S. mansoni genome database now contains v4.0 of the genome. Some gene predictions may have been deleted or added between the versions. Both the v4.0 and v3.1 gene predictions can be viewed as separate tracks of annotation in
