   About GeneDB
  </span>
 </h2>
 <p>
  The GeneDB project is a core part of the Sanger Institute's Pathogen Genomics activities. Its primary goals are:
 </p>
 <pre>
  * to provide reliable access to the latest sequence data and annotation/curation for the whole range oforganisms sequenced by the Pathogen group.
  * to develop the website and other tools to aid the community in accessing and obtaining the maximum value from these data.
 </pre>
 <p>
  GeneDB currently provides access to more than 40 genomes, at various stages of completion, from early access to partial genomes with automatic annotation through to complete genomes with extensive manual curation.

  Matt obtained his Ph.D. in Botany from the University of British Columbia in 2006 in Prof. Patrick Keeling's lab.  He then relocated to the UK where he joined Dr. Mark van der Giezen as a Wellcome Trust post-doctoral fellow at Queen Mary, University of London and the University of Exeter.  His work at the WTSI has focused on functional annotation of
  <i>
   Leishmania
  </i>
  genomes and assembly and annotation of the
  <i>
   Leishmania mexicana
  </i>
  genome.  He is also interested in evolutionary protistology, gene family evolution, lateral gene transfer, and strong coffee.
