        <h1>The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute Web Cookies Policy</h1>
    <p>Information that the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute collects from you.</p>
    <h3>What is a cookie?</h3>
		<div class="main-light-grey-top"></div>
		<div class="main-light-grey">
    <p>A cookie (sometimes known as web cookie, browser cookie or html 
cookie) is a small amount of data (&lt;4Kb) that is sent to your 
computer or web-enabled device (hereafter referred to as a "device") 
browser from a website's server.  The cookie can include a unique 
identifier within it.</p>
    <h4>Where does the cookie go?</h4>
    <p>The cookie is stored on your device's hard drive (this is often 
called "setting a cookie"). Each website that wishes to send you its 
cookie can only do so if your device's web browser preferences, that you
 can set personally, are set to allow this. To protect your privacy your
 device browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has sent
 to you, not the cookies sent to you by other websites. Many websites 
set one or more cookies to track online traffic through their website.</p>
    <p>Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute hosted websites, set cookies to store information about your:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>online preferences that allow us to tailor our websites to your data requirements</li>
      <li>access rights i.e. your ability to login to restricted services and the duration of that login</li>
      <li>Anonymous user tracking across our sites.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Users can set their device browsers to accept all cookies, to 
notify them when a cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at any 
time. The last of these means that certain personalised features cannot 
then be provided to that user and accordingly they may not be able to 
take full advantage of all of the website's features. Each browser is 
different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to 
change your cookie preferences.</p>
    <p>During the course of any visit to a Sanger Institute hosted 
website, the pages you see, along with a cookie, are downloaded to your 
device. This enables our website publishers to find out whether the 
device (and its user) has visited the website before. This is done on 
repeat visits by checking to see, and finding, the cookie left there on 
the last visit.</p>

    <h3>How does the Sanger Institute use cookies?</h3>
		<div class="main-light-grey-top"></div>
		<div class="main-light-grey">
    <p>There are three main uses:-</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Information supplied by cookies helps us to anonymously 
analyse the access patterns of visitors and helps us provide a better 
user experience.</li>
      <li>Web site usage. Many of the research funding agencies that 
provide funding for the Sanger Institute's research require annual 
reports to determine how often websites are visited by both academic and
 lay visitors.</li>
      <li>State information e.g. authentication or information about the user session.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Third Party Cookies and Flash Cookies</h4>
    <p>The Sanger Institute does not use information contained in cookies created by a third party or Flash cookies.</p>

  <p>* Urchin is a data collection and statistical package to monitor website usage (See section '<em>iii</em>' below)</p>
  <p>&#182; A full description of these cookies can be found at the following website <a title="https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsCookies" href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsCookies">https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsCookies</a></p>
  <p>In addition to the cookies set above further "strictly necessary" 
cookies are set for various web applications on other Sanger Institute 
hosted websites.  The usage and description of these cookies can be 
found on each individual website.</p>
  <p>These are used to provide session 'state' information i.e. 
authentication and user session identification but not for data 
collection. Their usage is described on the host website in question.</p>
