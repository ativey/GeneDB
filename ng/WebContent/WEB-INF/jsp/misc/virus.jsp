<p>flu infecting trachea cells,   R. Dourmashkin, (B0005752) Wellcome Images</p>

<p>Influenza viruses infecting cells of the trachea. Influenza viruses
(blue) attaching to the cells of the upper respiratory tract. Viruses
floating in the air are breathed in and bind to the hair-like microvilli
and cilia on the surface of the cells that line the trachea. They then
enter the cells and start to proliferate eventually causing the cells to
die and the symptoms of the disease to become apparent. The cilia are
the thicker projections that contain a core of microtubules and the
microvilli are the thinner projections without a core. Transmission

<p>Virus infections are one of the major causes of disease. Viruses that have
been controlled in some countries through vaccination still cause devastating disease in
other parts of the world. New virus diseases continue to emerge such as Human
Immunodeficiency virus infection and viruses long linked with human disease such as
Influenza continue to evolve causing new infections each year. The aim of the Virus
Genomics Team is to understand how genetic changes in viruses and hosts influence the
biological properties of viral pathogenesis, persistence and host susceptibility
to infection.</p>
