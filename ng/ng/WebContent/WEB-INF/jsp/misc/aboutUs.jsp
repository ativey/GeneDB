<h2>About GeneDB</h2>
<p>The GeneDB project is a core part of the Sanger Institute's Pathogen Genomics activities.
 Its primary goals are:</p>
<ul>
<li>to provide reliable access to the latest sequence data and annotation/curation for the
whole range oforganisms sequenced by the Pathogen group.</li>
<li>to develop the website and other tools to aid the community in accessing and obtaining
the maximum value from these data.</li>
</ul>
<p>GeneDB currently provides access to 35 genomes, at various stages of completion,
 from early access to partial genomes with automatic annotation through to complete
genomes with extensive manual curation.</p>
