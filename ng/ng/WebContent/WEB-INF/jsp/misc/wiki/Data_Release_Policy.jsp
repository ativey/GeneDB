 <p>
  The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute is committed to data sharing wherever possible. This maximises the value and scientific impact of the data, and ensures transparency and equity in exploitation of the opportunities created.

 <p>
  Annotated sequences represented in GeneDB are of two main types:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   those already available from public sequence databases (e.g. NCBI or EMBL)
  </li>
  <li>
   for some organisms, unfinished, assembled shotgun contigs, with semi-automatic analyses and annotation
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Sequence datasets are available for the organisms represented in GeneDB.

   Obtaining permission
  </span>
 </h2>
 <p>
  Please note that permission of the principal investigator should be obtained before publishing solely bioinformatic analyses (e.g. metabolic reconstruction, synteny) of unpublished sequence/open reading frames/genes on a chromosome- or genome-wide scale.
 </p>
 <p>
  Datasets (both sequence and analyses) are updated on a regular basis. As there has been a considerable investment in both acquiring the data, and undertaking these analyses, we request that you follow the accompanying guidelines when using data obtained directly from the GeneDB web site. Data or analyses obtained from "external" sources (e.g. keywords from
  <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/swissprot/" class="external text" title="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/swissprot/" rel="nofollow">
   SWISSPROT
  </a>
  ) should be credited as appropriate to the originating source, which in some cases, holds copyright.

 <h2>
  <span class="mw-headline">
   Acknowledgement
  </span>
 </h2>
 <p>
  Users of sequence data from the sequencing centres (see below) should not publish or otherwise disseminate the information without acknowledgement. An appropriate format is as follows:
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   These data were produced by the xxx Sequencing Group at the yyy Sequencing Centre and can be obtained from zzz.
  </b>
 </p>
 <p>
  where "xxx" is the name of the relevant sequencing project, such as "Trypanosoma brucei" , "yyy" is the sequencing centre/submitter, and "zzz" is either an appropriate ftp directory, or a http URL, whence the data have been obtained. If an EMBL/Genbank accession number has been assigned to a sequence, this should be also be quoted.
 </p>
 <p>
  For sequencing projects that are still in progress (e.g. Leishmania), please ensure that you use the latest available version of unfinished sequences.
