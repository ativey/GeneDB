  Kinetoplastids are a taxon of Euglenozoan eukaryotes which includes both free-living and parasitic forms. Most prominent among these are members of the Trypanosomatida, which includes the Leishmania and Trypanosoma genera, the causative agents of human diseases such as Chaga's disease, Kala-azar and cutaneous Leishmaniasis.

  Kinetoplastids possess a unique set of molecular biological features such as polycistronic transcription, cis/trans-splicing, antigenic variation, modulation of host immune response, compartmentalisation of glycolysis and a unique form of RNA-editing specific to the unusual mitochondrial DNA (kinetoplast) of this group.
