 <p>
  The
  <i>
   Leishmania
  </i>
  parasite is an intracellular pathogen of the immune system targeting macrophages and dendritic cells. The disease Leishmaniasis affects the populations of 88 counties worldwide with symptoms ranging from disfiguring cutaneous and muco-cutaneous lesions that can cause widespread destruction of mucous membranes to visceral disease affecting the haemopoetic organs.
 </p>
 <p>
  The species of the
  <i>
   L. donovani
  </i>
  complex are found in different geographical regions.
  <i>
   L. donovani
  </i>
  is the primary cause of visceral leishmaniasis in the Indian subcontinent and East Africa,
  <i>
   L. infantum
  </i>
  in the the Mediterranean region and
  <i>
   L. chagasi
  </i>
  in the New World. While the last two species are genetically identical, all three species are very similar.
  <i>
   L. infantum
  </i>
  was chosen as the second
  <i>
   Leishmania
  </i>
  species to sequence after
  <i>
   L. major
  </i>
  because it is part of the
  <i>
   L. donovani
  </i>
  complex and is an adaptable species for experimentation. For more information on visceral Leishmaniasis we recommend the WHO website (

 <p>
  We have generated a whole genome shotgun, to ~5x coverage, of L. infantum clone JPCM5 (MCAN/ES/98/LLM-877). This was completed in October 2003. This project is a collaboration with

 <p>
  GeneDB has been funded by Wellcome Trust to provide full curation support for kinetoplastida genomes to meet the needs of the community.

  New annotations are constantly being added to keep up with published manuscripts and feedback from the Trypanosomatid research community. In collaboration with GeneDB, the EuPathDB genomic sequence data and annotations are regularly deposited on
