  <i>
   Trypanosoma vivax
  </i>
  is a major livestock pathogen in Africa and some South American countries. Despite the severe disease it causes,
  <i>
   T. vivax
  </i>
  remains largely unstudied.

 <p>
  The Sanger Institute's Pathogen Genomics group, in collaboration with Professor David Barry (Glasgow University, UK), Dr Alberto Davila (Instituto Oswalso Cruz, Brazil) and Dr Phelix Majiwa (International Livestock Institute, Kenya), has carried out a partial genome shotgun of this parasite. The current coverage is 5x.

  New annotations are constantly being added to keep up with published manuscripts and feedback from the Trypanosomatid research community. In collaboration with GeneDB, the EuPathDB genomic sequence data and annotations are regularly deposited on

 <p>
  This sequencing centre plans on publishing the completed and annotated sequences in a peer-reviewed journal as soon as possible. Permission of the principal investigator should be obtained before publishing analyses of the sequence/open reading frames/genes on a chromosome or genome scale. For further information see our data release policy.
